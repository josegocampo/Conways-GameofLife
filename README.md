## About 

Conway's Game of Life is the classic cellular automaton built by the great mathematician John Conway.

Conway  sadly passed away in April due to covid complications and I built this project to commemorate his life. 

I noticed there was no spanish version of the Game of Life, so I managed to get a pretty good domain and I decided to built the app and host it there so this incredibly genius gains more  recognition between in the spanish speaking world.

I even wrote an [essay](https://www.joseocampo.org/conway) about his work and the game of life on [my website](https://www.joseocampo.org/) 

There is still some work to be done in regards to media queries and some other functionalities I want to add.
